# Simple-Linear-Regression-IRIS_DATA

**Objective:**

This assignment will guide us through the implementation of Simple Linear Regression using Python and Scikit-learn. I'll work with the Iris dataset to predict one feature based on another, gaining hands-on experience with data preparation, model training, prediction, and evaluation.

**Performed:**

Import the following Python libraries: pandas, train_test_split, LinearRegression, matplotlib.pyplot, and load_iris.

Load the Iris dataset using Scikit-learn and convert it into a Pandas DataFrame.

Display the first five rows of the dataset.

Choose 'sepal length (cm)' as the feature (X) and 'petal length (cm)' as the target variable (y).

Split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split. Use a random state of 42 for reproducibility.

Create and Train the Model

Create a LinearRegression model and train it using the training data.

Predict the Target Variable

Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set.

Plot the Actual vs Predicted Values

Create a scatter plot of the actual values vs. the predicted values.

On the same plot, draw the regression line to visualize the model's fit.

Label the x-axis as 'Sepal Length (cm)' and the y-axis as 'Petal Length (cm)'. Include a legend for clarity.
